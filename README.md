# How to use
Open the app and navigate to the scanning activity. If you are using a physical device, find an isbn barcode to scan. If you are using an emulator, set your camera settings to display a barcode in the virtual environment. 

Note: App fetches data from the google books API, the barcode you scan may not exist there! If it doesn't, try another. (The Harry Potter books work well)
